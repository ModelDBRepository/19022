Submillisecond AMPA receptor-mediated signaling at a principal 
neuron-interneuron synapse.
Neuron 1997 Jun;18(6):1009-23

Abstract:
Glutamatergic transmission at a principal neuron-interneuron synapse 
was investigated by dual whole-cell patch-clamp recording in rat 
hippocampal slices combined with morphological analysis. Evoked EPSPs 
with rapid time course (half duration = 4 ms; 34 degrees C) were 
generated at multiple synaptic contacts established on the interneuron 
dendrites close to the soma. The underlying postsynaptic conductance 
change showed a submillisecond rise and decay, due to the precise timing
of glutamate release and the rapid deactivation of the postsynaptic AMPA 
receptors. Simulations based on a compartmental model of the interneuron 
indicated that the rapid postsynaptic conductance change determines the 
shape and the somatodendritic integration of EPSPs, thus enabling 
interneurons to detect synchronous principal neuron activity.
